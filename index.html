        <h2>Benedict "Beck" Collanto Cruto</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Benedict "Beck" Collanto Cruto. I'm a Computer Science Student in Visayas State University. This page is a little bit about me and my life.</p>
        
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Ever since I can remember, I've had a passion for video games. What started as a simple hobby quickly turned into a fascination with the worlds, characters, and stories that unfold on my screen. While my friends talked about becoming astronauts or doctors, I knew my dream was to create the very games I love to play. I spend hours sketching out my own game ideas, designing levels on graph paper, and even learning to code small projects online. To me, video games are more than just entertainmentâ€”they're a way to connect with people, tell stories, and bring my imagination to life. My biggest dream is to one day become a game developer, crafting experiences that others can enjoy and get lost in, just as I have.</p>
